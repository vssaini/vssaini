![I like to build business solutions](https://res.cloudinary.com/vssaini/image/upload/v1597162039/I_like_to_build_business_solutions_bgcxui.jpg)

An avid learner with 9+ years of experience in .NET.  Highly efficient in interacting with international clients. Assist organizations in building complex web applications using .NET Core that solve business requirements.

As an Intern developer, for my first assignment, I completely overhaul the existing website and revamp it to a much better one (UX & features) by self-learning.

Later, I explore freelancing with one year of internship experience. I paddled my way through different gigs. Eventually, I established rapport with a UK client (http://www.dovestones.com/) and served for more than 3.5 years with excellent deliverables. I worked on complex software and web applications based on AD.

I am a GNIITian and certified expert on Experts-Exchange. I had earned Master, Guru and Wizard certificates for my contribution. I love to write code and have a knack for writing clean code. I study over Pluralsight for keeping myself improvised.
