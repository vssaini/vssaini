![I like to build business solutions](https://res.cloudinary.com/vssaini/image/upload/v1597162039/I_like_to_build_business_solutions_bgcxui.jpg)

I'm a full-stack .NET Core Developer with 9+ yrs experience & specialization in developing web apps from scratch. Highly efficient in understanding requirements and project management. I have pleasure experience of working with clients from UK, USA, Israel and Denmark.

I have developed apps for Dovestones Software (https://dovestones.com/) and Zenegy (https://zenegy.com/en). In the last two years, I have developed complex applications (https://payroll.zenegy.com/en/apps/) as Google Calendar, Office 365 Calendar & Planday for Zenegy.

I am a GNIITian and certified expert on Experts-Exchange (https://www.experts-exchange.com/members/vs00saini.html). I had received Master, Guru and Wizard certificates for my contribution. I love to write code and have a knack for writing clean code. I study over Pluralsight (https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/vssaini) for improving my craft.
