![I like to build business solutions](https://res.cloudinary.com/vssaini/image/upload/v1597162039/I_like_to_build_business_solutions_bgcxui.jpg)

I am a GNIIT-ian having 6+ years of experience with a passion for creating solutions that help end-users automate their task and solve business requirements.

I'm a self-learner and know my way through new technologies. For my very first assignment, as an alone developer, I was able to completely overhaul the existing website and revamp it to working one by self-teaching.

Later on, I started as a freelancer with one year of the Internship experience. I paddled my way through different gigs. Eventually, I was able to establish rapport with the client (http://www.dovestones.com/) for more than 3.5 years with excellent deliverables. Most recently, we have been implementing the automatic transferring of Payroll data from one company to another company using their existing API.

I am a certified expert on Experts-Exchange. I had earned a Master, Guru and Wizard certificates for my contribution. I love to write code and have a knack of writing clean code. To keep up with technologies, I regularly study over Pluralsight. I have a motto to do only best on any projects.
